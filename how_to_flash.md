## Flashing

For flashing you need a USB-to-serial adapter that supports 3.3V and has the required pins. The board includes an auto-reset circuit so you don't need to manually ground GPIO0 or press any buttons during flashing if you have an adapter with DTR and RTS. If not, you need to manually ground GPIO0. The rest of the flashing process is identical to other ESP32 and ESPHome devices.

| USB-to-serial adapter | Programming header of the board |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| VCC                   | 3V3                             |
| GND                   | GND                             |
| TX                    | RX                              |
| RX                    | TX                              |
| DTR                   | DTR                             |
| RTS                   | RTS                             |

If your USB-to-serial adapter can't supply enough power to flash the ESP32 you can disconnect `3V3` and connect an external power supply (12-30V DC) to the `BUS+` and `BUS-` pins.

## Installation

Before connecting the device to the ABB-Welcome bus it is recommended to check the bus voltage. It should be between 20V and 30V DC. Above 36V the device can take damage. Connect the positive wire to `BUS+` and the negative wire to `BUS-`. If the TX LED lights up continuously after connecting you should disconnect the wires and check your yaml configuration. The device has protection against reverse polarity and a resettable fuse.

Note: You are responsible for connecting the device to your system and for the firmware you upload. The author of this project takes no responsibility for any damages.
